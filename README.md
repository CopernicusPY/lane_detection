# lane_detection
* This is a project that without any **advanced computer-vision** (model training, neural networks etc.) can track lines from a live camera-feed/video.
* It's purpose is to simulate how self-driving cars detect the road. 

* This project is made using open-cv and python.

# Configuration
lane_detector is 100% customizable. To configure lane_detection to your needs head over to [config.json](./config.json). Just tweak the values to your needs. (The key names are pretty self explanatory
(I think its not necessary to mention that this project doesn't reach in any level the car's software, its just for a school project)
